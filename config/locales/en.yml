# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

    history:
      title: History
      history1: The story of the Award dates back to 1984 when in the city of Łódź polish SFF clubs
        decided to establish Sfinks Fandom Award. At this time Award was supposed to be given
        only in one category – the best speculative fiction literary work. In the beginning of 1985 in
        Świnoujście it was decided that the award will be awarded during Polcons. On the 8 th June
        1985 clubs voted to give the Sfinks Award for the best Speculative Fiction work of 1984 to
        Janusz A. Zajdel for his novel – Paradyzja (English - Paradise, the World in Orbit). The
        organizers invited author to the first Polcon that was taking place in Błażejewko in October
        1985. Unfortunately Janusz. A. Zajdel died on 19 th July 1985. His wife accepted the Award
        in his name at Polcon 1986 in Katowice.
      history2: The Polcon Organization Committee decided to change the name of the Award to The
        Janusz. A. Zajdel Award and Jadwiga Zajdel became the patron of the Award. Since then it
        is usually her who presents the Award during Polcons.
      history3: Since 1990 Janusz A. Zajdel Award voting was given to the Polcon members (before it was
        voted by the representatives of SFF clubs) and the nominations became open to all fans of
        the speculative fiction.
      history4: The statuette was firstly presented during Polcon in 1991. It was designed by Wiesław
        Bielak - professor of Kraków Academy of the Fine Arts.
        In 1992 last major change was applied to the award. It was decided that there will be two
        categories instead of one.

    patron:
      title: Janusz A. Zajdel
      about-zajdel1: The patron and the first person to be awarded by the fandom community. Born in 1938 in Warsaw, he was not only an author of science-fiction, but also a precursor of socio-fantasy in Poland. He graduated from physics at the University of Warsaw and he was working for several years in Centralne Laboratorium Ochrony Radiologicznej as a specialist in physics of atomic nucleus.
      about-zajdel2: As a fantasy author he made his debut in “Młody technik” magazine with a short story “Tau Wieloryba”.
        He published over 50 of short stories in various magazines. His first works were faithful to classic SF convention. His main achievement was a series of socio-political novels, with the first in this cycle “Cylinder van Troffa” published in 1980. In his works Zajdel presented and studied totalitarian, controlled and restricted societies. Often they were dystopian stories proving the impossibility of creating a perfect society by forcibly established rules. “Limes inferior” was for many years thought to be his best work, showing Earth where alien civilization enforced “one true” system, which is constantly monitored by “Big Brother”.
      about-zajdel3: His works were translated into Belarusian, Czech, Esperanto, Finnish, German, Russian, Slovenian and Hungarian. He was an active member of international science fiction fandom and World SF. In 1973 he received Magnum Trophaeum badge for cooperation with „Młody Technik”. In 1980 he was awarded by Ministry of Culture and Art for “Cylinder van Troffa”. Four years later he was given Złota Sepulka for "Wyjście z cienia”.
      about-zajdel4: He died in 1985 of pulmonary cancer and he didn’t have enough time to collect Polish Fandom’s Award Sfinks for “Paradyzja”. In 1986 the name of this award was changed to honor Janusz A. Zajdel.

    voting:
      title: Voting System
      voting1: Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is a type of ranked preferential vote counting method used in single-seat elections with more than two candidates. IRV is also sometimes referred to as the alternative vote (AV), preferential voting, single transferable voting (New Zealand), or, in the United States, ranked-choice voting (RCV), though these names are also used for other systems.
      voting2: Like all ranked ballot voting systems, instead of indicating support for only one candidate, voters in IRV elections can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each voters top choice. If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that candidate wins. If not, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated.
      voting3: The voters who selected the defeated candidate as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a candidate has more than half of the votes. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an "instant runoff" that allows a comparison of the top two candidates head-to-head.
